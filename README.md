# Sudoku Microservice Java Web Service

This project demonstrates how to develop a microfrontend web application using Java without any MVC framework and JavaFX. It provides a simple UI for users to enter a number, validate the input, and display alerts based on the validation result. The validation is performed by calling an external Sudoku microservice.
